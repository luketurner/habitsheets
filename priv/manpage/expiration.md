# Expiration

[home](?manpage=home) | [close](?)

Normally, habits "expire" after a single day -- meaning, when you complete a habit, it's available to complete again the very next day (or the next recurring interval, see [Recurring Intervals](?manpage=recurrence)).

If you want to adjust this behavior -- for example, to have a habit "expire" after two days instead of one -- set the **expiration** in the habit's settings to 2.

To use a more specific example, perhaps you have an air filter that needs to be replaced every 30 days, so you set the habit's expiration to 30. Then, when you complete the habit, it won't appear on your daily habit lists for the next 29 days. When the habit appears again, you know the filter is due for a replacement!
