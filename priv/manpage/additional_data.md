# Additional Data

[home](?manpage=home) | [close](?)

Habits can have additional data fields associated with them beyond a yes/no status:

- **Count** fields record positive integer like: number of squats, number of times you said thank you, etc.
- **Measurement** fields record continuous quantities from some measurement or calculation, like: weight, number of calories, distance walked, etc.
- **Duration** fields record durations, like: duration of run, duration of meditation, etc.
- **Text** fields record arbitrary textual data, like: notes about weather, mood, etc.

Habits with additional data are considered "complete" for a day when any additional data is recorded.
