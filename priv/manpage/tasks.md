# Tasks and Agendas

[home](?manpage=home) | [close](?)

Habitsheets can track **tasks** as well as habits. Unlike habits, tasks can be **completed** and they don't recur or expire.

When you open Habitsheets for a particular day, you will have the option to generate an **agenda** with a list of tasks to accomplish that day. The tasks in the agenda are chosen from the pool of all incomplete tasks recorded in Habitsheets at the time the agenda is generated.

Habitsheets uses agendas to avoid the problem of an overwhelming list of tasks that can occur when you brain-dump into a trusted system (to use GTD terminology). Instead of showing you a list of _every_ task in the daily view, Habitsheets picks **at most 5 tasks** to display for each day.

Tags can be labeled **important** and/or **urgent**, which impacts how Habitsheets selects the tasks for agendas:

- **Important and urgent** tasks are always picked first.
- **Urgent** tasks are picked next.
- **Important** tasks are picked next. A maximum of 2 important but non-urgent tasks are picked.
- **Not important or urgent** tasks are picked last. A maximum of two of these tasks are picked.

Aside from the above constraints, tasks are chosen randomly, _not_ in priority order. You can shuffle the tasks you've received, or request more tasks.
