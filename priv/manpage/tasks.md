# Tasks and Agendas

[home](?manpage=home) | [close](?)

Habitsheets can track **tasks** as well as habits. Unlike habits, tasks can be **completed** and they don't recur or expire.

When you open Habitsheets for a particular day, an **agenda** is generated with a list of tasks to accomplish that day. The tasks in the agenda are chosen from the pool of all incomplete tasks recorded in Habitsheets at the time the agenda is generated.

Habitsheets uses agendas to avoid the problem of an overwhelming list of tasks that can occur when you brain-dump into a trusted system (to use GTD terminology). Instead of showing you a list of _every_ task in the daily view, Habitsheets picks about 5 tasks to display for each day.

Tags can be labeled **important** and/or **urgent**, which impacts how Habitsheets selects the tasks for agendas.

- ALL **urgent** tasks are included in the agenda.
- 2 **important** tasks are included in the agenda.
- 2 non-urgent, non-important tasks are included in the agenda.
