# Recurring Intervals

[home](?manpage=home) | [close](?)

Normally, habits are assumed to recur daily, meaning the habit appears in your habit list on every single day.

If you want to change this behavior, you can define **recurring intervals** in the habit settings. If any recurring intervals are defined, the habit will only be shown on days that it's due to recur.

For example, if a habit has a recurring interval of "every 2 weeks starting on Friday", that habit will only appear to complete on those specific days -- every 2 weeks starting on Friday. On other days, say Thursdays, the habit will not appear in your habit list.

If multiple intervals are defined, the habit will appear on days matching _any_ of the intervals. For example, if a habit has two intervals, one every week on Thursday and one every week on Friday, the habit will appear on both Thursday and Friday every week!

The following types of recurring intervals are supported:

- **Daily** (the default when all recurring intervals are removed) :: The habit recurs every day.
- **Weekly** :: The habit recurs every N weeks on the specified day of the week.
